5. TROUBLESHOOTING VERIFICATION FAILURES

   Common issues:
   
   a) Wrong credentials
      → Double-check your email and password
      → Make sure you're using the correct Purelymail account
   
   b) SMTP not enabled
      → Login to Purelymail dashboard
      → Check if SMTP is enabled for your account
   
   c) Port blocked
      → Port 587 must be open on your network
      → Try from a different network if blocked
   
   d) App password required
      → Some providers require app-specific passwords
      → Check Purelymail settings for app passwords

WHAT VERIFICATION DOES
================================================================================

The verification process:
1. Connects to smtp.purelymail.com:587
2. Initiates STARTTLS encryption
3. Authenticates with your username/password
4. Confirms the connection is valid
5. Updates provider status to "verified"

Once verified, you can:
- Send campaigns using this provider
- The system trusts the credentials are valid
- Rate limiting is enforced based on provider settings

================================================================================
AFTER VERIFICATION

Next steps:
